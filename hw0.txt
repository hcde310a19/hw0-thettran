# Description of your program (part 7)
A word is defined as a distinct group of characters.
The groups of characters are separated by spaces/whitespace.
As you proceed through the characters, you keep a count and
increment the count by one as you find a distinct group of
characters separated by whitespace.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
This exercise was both easy and difficult. With programming
experience, my thought process immediately jumped to the
code that would accomplish the task. Dialing it back and
thinking in pure english was definitely difficult. It was
unsatisfying because the code is quite simple, but this
exercise made it more annoying.

I am excited to work on a project and dealing with data!
I took a web programming course, so I have learned about API's
before, but at that time I was struggling to understand
what was going on, so I am excited to go into this course with
some basic background knowledge. Python as a language seems
exciting too. It is also nice to hear that collaboration is
encouraged, which is quite different than other CS classes.
